In HTML,

Our objects inside the DOM can have properties and methods.
- Properties describle something about the object.
- Methods are actions we can perform on the object.


Using javascript, we can access these properties and methods.

Ex: Car
- Properties: color, model, weight
- Methods: start(), stop(), drive()

Getter:
- Get the value of a property.
- Syntax: object.property
- Ex: car.color; //red

Setter:
- Set the value of a property.
- Syntax: object.property = value
- Ex: car.color = 'blue';

Methods:
- Perform actions on the object.
- Syntax: object.method()
- Ex: car.start();

NOTE: Difference between methods and functions is that methods are functions that an object can perform.
